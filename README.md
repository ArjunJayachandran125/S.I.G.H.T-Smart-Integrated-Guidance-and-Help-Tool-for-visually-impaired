# S.I.G.H.T-Smart-Integrated-Guidance-and-Help-Tool-for-visually-impaired
Created a wearable device that can carry out four objectives: Emotion Detection, Collision Avoidance, Object Detection  and Optical Character Recognition. 
The hardware was implemented on raspberry pi and the required objective is chosen via audio response and the outputs of each objective is given to the user as an audio via headphones.
The file named Combined.py has the code of all the four objectives in one python file.
The file named FER model has the emotion detection model which was trained for 30 epochs.
